# Crestron-Pushbullet
Crestron Simpl# Module to Send a Pushbullet Notification.

- This is an inital commit for proof of concept. Sending a Message does work.  
- Would like to add sending a file and other push types.
- You will need your access code which can be retrieved from the Pushbullet Website.
- S+ Is setup to allow messages to be pushed to several users based on Email Address.
- If the Email Address does not exist as a pushbullet user, an email will be sent instead. 
- Messages are not automatically sent to the user that the Access_Code is assigned to.
- You must respecify the email address for that account.
